My name is Joseph DiMino, I grew up on Long Island. I’ve taken CS1-CS3, assembly, SE, and OOP here at NP. Assembly and SE were my favorite so far. 
I’m a computer science major with a business analytics minor. I was in a program called FIRST Robotics in HS where I got to work on robots for competitions.
I got to work with different sensors and their data, notably vision (limelight, raspi). We used Java with WPILIB.  
I’ve used different distributions of linux for different purposes, like installing a lightweight distro for better performance on an older machine or just to learn and experiment with barebones distros like arch or raspbian os lite.
I’ve done some web programming to the extent of making myself and hosting a static portfolio website. For that project, I used the following: html/css/tailwind/bootstrap studio/JS/NJS/Express.  
I enjoyed the process of web development it’s something I haven’t done in a while, and I want to be better at. 
I want to learn the techniques and knowledge that you have to offer to apply to my future career in the field.
